# Fenix A3xx Chrono button click spot

Allows to have the thottle in incremental mode and automatically set Flex and Climb detents with a click on the captain side chrono button.

How to use:
 - Increase throttle above idle but bellow climb detent
 - Wait for engines stable and press chrono button; throttle will go to flex detent
 - Once you see Climb indication in the PFD, press chrono button; throttle will go to climb detent

But i want to use TO/GA takeof:
 - Manually advance throttle to TO/GA
 - Once you see Climb indication in the PFD, press chrono button; throttle will go to climb detent

I made this as an exercise for MSFS's sdk and wasm module development.
I'm not responsible in any way for any issue that this module can cause, nor will i provide any support.
Also please don't ask fenix for support.
